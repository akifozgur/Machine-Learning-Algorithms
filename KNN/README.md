The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (KNN) is a supervised machine learning classification algorithm. 'K' represents the number of nearest neighbors the classifier will use to make predictions.

The k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm is a distance-based algorithm. Its fundamental working principle involves classifying data by using the distances and similarities between them. In this technique, data is stored in a pattern space. When data of an unknown class is presented, the algorithm identifies the k nearest data points to determine the class of the unknown data. Subsequently, the data is labeled with the class of the k nearest neighbors to which it bears the most resemblance.
