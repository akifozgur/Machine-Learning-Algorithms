![Regression](regression5.png)

  In this notebook, we will learn what Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, and Polynomial Regression are, and we will make examples of how their models are implemented with the Scikit-learn library. Then, we will evaluate the Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression models together with the R-Square method.
